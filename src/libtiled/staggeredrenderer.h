/**
 * A staggered isometric renderer.
 *
 * This renderer is meant to be used with isometric tiles, but rather than
 * doing a true isometric projection the tiles are shifted in order to fit
 * together. This has the advantage that the map has a rectangular shape.
 *
 * Only one variation of staggered map rendering is supported at the moment,
 * namely shifting the uneven rows to the right.
 *
 * Objects are handled the same way as the OrthogonalRenderer, though they
 * snap at half the tile width and height.
 *
 * At the moment, several Tiled features will not work correctly with this
 * renderer. This is due to the way the shifting messes with the coordinate
 * system. List of known issues:
 *
 *   Fill tool:
 *
 *     Doesn't work properly cause its assumptions about neighboring are
 *     broken by this renderer.
 *
 *   Stamp tool:
 *
 *     A stamp only makes sense if it's placed at an even y offset from
 *     where it was created. When moved by an uneven y offset, the rows
 *     that are shifted swap, messing up the stamp.
 *
 *     The circle and line drawing modes of the stamp tool won't work
 *     properly due to the irregular coordinate system.
 *
 *   Rectangular select tool:
 *
 *     This one will appear to behave somewhat erratic.
 *
 *   Map resize and offset actions:
 *
 *     Similar problem as with stamps when offsetting at an uneven y offset.
